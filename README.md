.Step to run the project locally--

To run a Node.js project from GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:


Clone the Repository:
On the GitHub repository page, click on the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Run the command git clone <repository-URL> by replacing <repository-URL> with the copied URL.

Set Up and Run the Node.js Project:
Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned project directory using cd <project-name>.
Once inside the project directory, run npm install to install the project's dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Configure Environment Variables:
If the project uses environment variables, create a .env file (if not provided) and set the required variables. Refer to any provided .env.example file or project documentation for required variables.

Run the Project:
After the installation completes, run the project. The command to start a Node.js project might be  npm run dev, or specified in the project's documentation.
  example:-
  git clone git@github.com:riuu16/eqaim.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the project
npm run dev
